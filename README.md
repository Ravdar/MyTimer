#MyTimer
MyTimer is a simple timer application written in Python. The application allows users to input hours, minutes, and seconds, and start a countdown timer. It also provides buttons for pausing, resetting, and restarting the timer. At the end of the countdown, the application plays a buzzer sound to notify the user.

#Installation
To run the application, make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using pip:

#Usage
To start the timer, run the timer.py file using the following command:

The timer GUI will appear, and you can input the desired countdown time using the hours, minutes, and seconds fields. Once you click the "Start" button, the countdown will begin. You can use the "Pause", "Reset", and "Restart" buttons as needed.
